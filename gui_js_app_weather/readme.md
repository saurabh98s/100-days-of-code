DAY 3:
SO yes! i was a bit late on my challenge timings , as i was having my quizzes going on and multiple other priorities and couldnt give time to my GUI.
So today i cranked it up  bit and completed a WEATHER_APP which uses darksky's API for weather services.
Problems faced:
Again the CORS errors came up ,luckily the tutorial i was folowing gave me a way out.
using https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ i created a proxy for the web app.
API used: https://api.darksky.net/forecast/a3a6ea1f749ce80117a2caa3397257db/27.1819063,88.503338
TO DO tommorow:
NOW no more GUI ,we will begin with DATA STRUCTURES.
