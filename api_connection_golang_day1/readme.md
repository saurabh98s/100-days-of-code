so day1 went on great, i had created a web api using golang, today i used JS to create a basic web page to display those elements retrieving from the api.
i did that but as i havent paid my cloud bills :P i was forced to use an free elephant sql database to make it work, i have included an screenshot for it. 
Day 2 wil be spend on taking a large dataset and implementing it using the same principle.
Signin off.
